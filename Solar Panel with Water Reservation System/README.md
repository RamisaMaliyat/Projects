The objective of this project is to implement a system utilizing rooftop solar panels and a water reservoir for multipurpose use in urban areas. During sunlight and no rain, the solar panels generate electricity while reserving excess power. During rain, the panels adjust to allow rainwater collection into a reservoir. Once the reservoir is full, excess water is redirected for garden irrigation.
